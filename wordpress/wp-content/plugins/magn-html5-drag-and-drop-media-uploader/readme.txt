Magn WP Drag and Drop Upload

== Description ==

Magn WP Drag and Drop Upload helps to save your time while uploading images to WordPress posts. By using Drag And Drop Upload plugin you can automagically
upload your images to WordPress posts thanks to HTML5 and an drag and drop upload script. At the end, you'll see that saves lot of time while uploading your
images to WP posts. This is an innovative way to upload your images to WordPress and save time. I created this plugin based on the great Ajax Upload plugin
developed by Valums.

This plugin can only work on modern web browsers and takes advantage of HTML5 Drag and Drop support.

How was the old process?

1. Create a new post
2. Click on the Upload Image icon
3. Let's wait for the popup to appear
4. Click on the Upload button
5. Choose the image in your hard drive or remote url
6. Click on Accept
7. Click on Insert into Post option

How it works with Magn WP Drag and Drop Upload?

1. Create a new post
2. Drag and drop your image (not inside the editor, please)

Easy, right?

Here is a list of features:

1. Automagically insert the image in a desired format into the post editor.
2. Creates an attachment for the post you are intersting the image on.
3. Support multiple files at once (just drag and drop multiple images to the WordPress admin panel and voila!)

Wish list:

1. Change file name on the fly.
2. Add SEO features, improve image attributes and support filename management.
3. Integratation with CDN plugins (currently not supported).
4. Finish the progress bar display.

Known bugs:

1. It is not inserting images when source code editor is active.
2. Only works for posts.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder (`dndupload`?) to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add write permissions to /wp-content/plugins/dndupload/temp 

Once the plugin is activated, you can go to New Post and a new meta box should appear under the editor.

How to use it

You can configure the default thumbnail image. This option is very useful if you want to avoid posting the full or large image in WordPress post. 
It is recommended to setup your Medium size dimensions and then configure the plugin to "send to editor" a medium size image instead of the full image.
